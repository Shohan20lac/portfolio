                <P> <a href="">Irrational Texts</a> was a Facebook page for fictional short stories. Each short story was a tiny episode
                    of much larger universes and multiverses that I had been conjuring up since before adolescence. Once I build enough 
                    game development skills to build fully functional virtual worlds from start to finish, many of these stories will be philosophical
                    foundation for future projects.

                <P class="lead">Philosophical Researcher</P>
                <P> I am fascinated by religious scriptures from all cultures. One of my favorite pastimes is to read about the teachings of 
                    ancient and modern religions alike. The more I read about their origins, successes, interpretations by society and eventual
                    extinctions, the more important clues i get about the nature of human beings and society. My career as an engineer is 
                    driven by a loyal belief in the <a href="https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/810">Socratic Method</a>  (i.e. "a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, 
                    based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.")
                    <br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shohanslines/">Shohansolo</a> is my personal facebook page where I periodically practice
                     expressing my philosophical thoughts in socially acceptable ways.
